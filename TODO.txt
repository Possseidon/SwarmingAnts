- TODO - 
[ ] Change Graph to have one start and a lot of food points
[ ] Get editor working
[ ] Random Point Generator
[ ] Delaunay triangulator
[ ] Running in realtime must update everything
[ ] Statistics
[ ] Save
[ ] New
[ ] Report T_T

- How do I want the editor to work -
-> Modes:
  - Points -> Create new points wherever you click or move points
  - Connections-> Allows dragging between points
  - Delete -> Removes point or connection you click on
  - Set Start -> Sets the start and then goes back to the move tool
  - Do Food -> Toggle food on the clicked point
-> Camera on right click, zoom using scroll
-> Clear connections
-> Clear all
-> Fill with food
-> Clear food
-> Generate NxM Net of points and connections
-> Generate Triangulation
-> Generate N random points

- New Ant Algorithm -
-> Spawn at start
-> Move
-> Record all points
-> If point is already passed, go back
-> Repeat until a food point is found
-> Then reset the list of recorded points
-> Repeat until all food points have been visited (and, if necessary, the start has been reached)

Pseudocode:

spawn ant;
while not done do
  find possible move;
  perform move;
  passedpoints[current]  
end
